# Welcome to Ocelot Brain Java wiki

Here you'll be able to find info on usage of Ocelot Brain Scala library in Java code. 
One shouldn't consider this to be a step-by-step guide to writing an OpenComputers emulator, because the information provided here describes only backend(logic) of the emulator.
Also, this wiki is NOT documentation for Ocelot Brain, it is more of a list of guides on how to use different functionality in Java code.
**The Scala code must always be implemented in a different way from what is provided on this wiki**

## Table of Contents:
1. Getting started with Ocelot Brain
2. Understanding main instance and workspaces
3. Use of components and their configuration
4. Event handling
5. Creating and loading emulator snapshots
6. Demo overview
