# Welcome to Ocelot Brain Java wiki

Here you'll be able to find info on usage of [Ocelot Brain](https://gitlab.com/cc-ru/ocelot/ocelot-brain) Scala library in Java code. 
One shouldn't consider this to be a step-by-step guide to writing an OpenComputers emulator, because the information provided here describes only interaction with the backend(logic) part of the emulator.
Also, this wiki is NOT a documentation for Ocelot Brain, it is more of a list of guides on how to use a particular function in Java code.

**Scala code should always be implemented differently from how it is presented in this wiki**
